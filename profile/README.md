# 🌿 Uverd Labs

**Uverd Labs** is a small R&D collective building open tools for:

- 🌲 **Forest monitoring & conservation**
- 🔥 **Early wildfire & smoke detection**
- 🚨 **Low-power alarm networks in remote areas**
- 📡 **LoRa / Meshtastic mesh + Raspberry Pi gateways**
- 🧠 **Edge ML for environmental signals (vibration, air quality, etc.)**

We work between **Spain** and **Ecuador**, focusing on practical systems that can be deployed in real forests, not just labs.

## 🔭 Focus Areas

- **TreeGuard** – vibration-based detection of logging & heavy impacts on trees  
- **FireGuard** – air-quality based early smoke / fire detection
- **WaterGuard** – water-quality based for conservation datasets / pollution detection  
- **ForestMesh** – LoRa / Meshtastic networks for remote sensors  
- **Gateways** – Raspberry Pi dashboards, alarm routing, and data logging

Most projects are built around:

- ESP32 / Heltec / RAK modules  
- Meshtastic firmware & custom modules  
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W gateways  
- Python (data analysis + classifiers), C++ (firmware), and a bit of web UI

---

## 🧩 Key Repositories

(Subject to change as things stabilise)

- **Meshtastic forks**
  - `meshtastic-device` – custom sensor modules (TreeGuard, FireGuard, etc.)
- **FireGuard AQ**
  - `fireguard-aq` – Arduino test sketches, Meshtastic integration notes, ML pipeline docs
- **Gateways**
  - `uverd-gateway` – Pi-based mesh gateways and air-quality dashboards

---

## 🤝 Contributing & Collaboration

We are open to:

- Field testing in real forests  
- Collaboration with universities, NGOs, and local communities  
- Contributions to firmware, gateways, and ML tooling  

To get involved:

1. Open an issue in the relevant repo
2. Or contact us through our GitHub profiles

## ⚖️ Values

- **Open where possible** – we open-source the parts that help the community  
- **Practical first** – must survive real weather, real power limits, and real users  
- **Local impact** – designs shaped by the realities of Ecology and R&D
